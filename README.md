# Python-and-ArcGIS-Integration

This repository contains the code to perform a Python and ArcGis Integration using API.<br>

The ArcGIS website offers an API to be used with Python to access the ArcGIS functionalities.<br> 

The API makes it easy and natural for a Python programmer to use ArcGIS, and conversely, an ArcGIS user to script and automate their GIS.<br>
The ArcGIS Online helps users build interactive maps that explain data and encourage users to explore. User map their own data and gain perspective by adding the authoritative location-based data. Use smart mapping to guide data exploration and visualization.

### Challenges: The ArcGIS do not work with all Python versions, in this case I used version 3.7<br>

For this reason we have created a Virtual Environment with the Python 3.7 version<br>

First: Install the ArcGIS using conda<br>

Comand: conda install -c esri arcgis<br>

Second: Connect to the API
